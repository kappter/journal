# ðŸŒ€ Daily Focus Journal Repository  
*A Living Record of Self, Cosmos, and Conscious Ritual*

---

## Overview

Welcome to the digital home of the **Daily Focus Journal**, a personal, richly layered self-tracking and reflection system I've maintained daily since 2016. Originally kept in Google Sheets, this journal now transitions to GitHub for preservation, exploration, and creative visualization.

This repository is a **chronicle of personal experience**, organized through a consistent structure that blends physical tracking, emotional reflection, spiritual insight, philosophical themes, and astronomical contextâ€”all mapped daily. The goal is not just to preserve the data, but to make it *sing* through visuals, interactivity, and connection.

## ðŸŒŸ Whatâ€™s Inside?

Each daily entry in the journal includes:

- **Temporal Metadata**: UNIX time, ISO date, day-of-year, week number.
- **Weather + Astronomy**: Local forecasts, sun/moon rise and set, planetary positions.
- **Physical Tracking**: Steps walked, shoulder and neck stretches, hydration and food logs.
- **Spiritual + Energetic Focus**: Daily chakra alignment, healing frequencies (e.g., 741 Hz), meditation themes.
- **Creative Practice**: Poetry forms, guitar scales/modes, fretboard diagrams, sound interval theory.
- **Mental & Emotional Reflection**: Tarot draws, journal entries, dictionary words, Roget/Dewey randomizations.
- **Micro-rituals**: Wordle, NYT Sudoku, tracking significant dates and anniversaries.

## ðŸš€ Project Goals

### Visualize the Invisible  
Transform years of structured journaling into meaningful **visual artifacts**, using charts, interactive timelines, mood maps, and constellation graphs of recurring thoughts, phrases, or concepts.

### Preserve Local Meaning  
This is a **self-contained knowledge archive**â€”no reliance on third-party APIs. Trends are derived from my own entries, independent of platform changes.

### Decode Rituals Over Time  
Track personal rhythms: How often did I reflect on grief? When did I switch creative modes from poetry to guitar? Do planetary alignments correlate with mindset shifts?

### Inspire Others to Reflect  
By open-sourcing this journal system (minus personal text), I hope to inspire others to build their own long-form data ritual.
